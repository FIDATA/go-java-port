= Go Java Port

This library contains ports of some standard Go packages to Java.

Some of Go features work more or less differently from their siblings in Java.
The goal of this library is to provide the same behavior as Go, avoiding any surprises.

This library can be used to port higher-level libraries from Go to Java.
It is used, for example,
by https://github.com/FIDATA/gradle-packer-plugin[org.fidata.packer] project.

Current version of port is made from Go 1.12.

Licensed under GPL version 2 only with Classpath exception.

== Usage

TODO: maven coordinates

All packages are classes are in `go` package. // TODO

Their structure resembles the same of Go.

For example, the following import in Go:

[source,go]
----
import (
 "os"
)
----

becomes the following in Java:

[source,java]
----
import go.Os;
----
